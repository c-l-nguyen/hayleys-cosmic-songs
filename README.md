Our team plans to track music data from the Billboard Hot 100 songs (singles) list from 1958-2017. We aim to uncover what genre of songs were most popular by year and how they have changed as well as how popularity of songs with various qualities, such as explicit content or "danceibility" scores based on analysis from Spotify, have changed over time. 

A few questions we will consider in our analysis:
* What genres were the most popular in the Billboard Hot 100 List? How has that changed over the years? Decades?
* How do we define "popularity" of a song?
* How has explicit content changed over time?
* Which artists appear the most in the list?
* Which song(s) appear the most in the list?
* How have certain qualities of the song (such as tempo, beat, "danceability") changed over the years within the Hot 100 list?
* Are there any qualities that are distinct about the most popular songs within a decade?
